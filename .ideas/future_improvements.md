# Future Improvements

This file contains a list of ideas for future improvements to the Enchantrix library.

-   **Fully implement the PGP module:** The PGP module is currently commented out due to dependency issues. This needs to be resolved so that the PGP functionality can be used.
-   **Define the `.trix` file format:** The `.trix` file format needs to be defined and implemented. This will be the standard file format for encrypted data.
-   **Build the rootFS passthrough storage:** The rootFS passthrough storage needs to be built. This will allow Web3 apps to use Enchantrix to give clients private keys securely.
